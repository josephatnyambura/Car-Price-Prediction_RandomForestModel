# Car Price Prediction - RandomForestModel

  
  <p align="justify">
Almost every task that requires estimation now uses some form of Machine Learning. Companies like <a href="https://www.cardekho.com/" target="_blank">CarDekho</a> employ algorithms like random forest to estimate the cost of old cars. The model inputs parameters that are connected to cars and produces a selling price. The following characteristics determine a car's selling price:    
  </p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Year of manufacture</li>
  <li>Selling price</li>
  <li>Present price</li>
  <li>Kilometer driven</li>
  <li>Seller type</li>
  <li>Transmission</li>
  <li>Owner</li>
</ul>
  <p align="justify">
Regression techniques can be used to resolve this problem, which is a supervised learning problem. The current challenge is to estimate a car's selling price depending on the attributes it has. Where our target or dependent variable is the selling price of a car, supervised regression issues call for labeled data. Other aspects are all independent variables.

    <p align="justify">
The regression techniques listed below can be used to forecast the selling price.
  </p></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Linear Regression</li>
  <li>Decision Tree Regressor</li>
  <li>Support Vector Regressor</li>
  <li>KNN Regressor</li>
  <li>Random Forest Regressor</li>
 </ul>

The performance of linear models on data with outliers is low despite their relative simplicity and explainability. On non-linear datasets, linear models are ineffective. Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor are two nonlinear regression algorithms that do better in such situations at fitting the nonlinear data.

In my model building process I have used `Random Forest Regressor` model and the data used in training and testing is from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho/" target="_blank">Kaggle.</a>
